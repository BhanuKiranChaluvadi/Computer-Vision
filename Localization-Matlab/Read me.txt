1. convert_image_format.m  
	converts images in a given folder from one format to another format, place the converted images in the desire
	folder and can label them in chronilocal order.

2. resize_images.m
	resize all the images in a given to the desired size.
	Resizing can help if you want to reduce the keypoint generated from an image. Which will make visualSFM and 
	vocab tree run faster. which can immensle help to quicly check you code for errors and quality of video
	before spending half day on visualSFM and vocab tree.

3. list_files.m
    list all the files of desired formated in a given folder.
	Having text file containing all the files in the folder will drasticaly reduce the work load on Matlab.
	Matlab can read each line and process the image rather than loading all the images at once and processing each.

4. change_listed_names.m
	can rename the text present in list file generated from list_files.m.
	eg: 10.jpg to 10.key or 10.png
	
5. wrapper.m ----> present in siftDemoV4_David LOWE
	Shift demo takes in one image in PGM format and will generate key file. 
	So a small wrapper function written on top of Shift Demo. So it input each file in a given folder to siftDemoV4_David
	and the generated key file is stored in the desired folder with out overwrittign the previous one.
	
6. The original sift.m take in pgm images. A small modification is done to original sift.m  to handle jpg or other formats.
